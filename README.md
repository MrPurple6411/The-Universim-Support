# The Universim Support for [Vortex]

## Description

This extension adds support for The Universim to [Vortex Mod Manager], enabling you to easily automate installation of mods for The Universim without having to worry about where the files are supposed to go, etc.

At this time, the following mod types are supported:

- BepInEx Pack for The Universim
- BepInEx plugins
- BepInEx patchers

If you are developing a different kind of mod and would like it to be supported by this extension, please [raise an issue or pull request on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/MrPurple6411/The-Universim-Support/issues) with a link to your mod page so that I can take a look at how you are packaging it. Please make sure to include instructions for how you would expect it to be installed, so that I can have Vortex automate the process. PRs welcome!

## How to install

This extension requires [Vortex] ^1.8.0. To install, click the Vortex button at the top of [the Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/699) to open this extension within Vortex, and then click `Install`. Alternatively, within Vortex, go to the `Extensions` tab, click "`Find More`" at the bottom of the tab, search for "The Universim Support" and then click `Install`.

You can also manually install it by downloading the main file and dragging it into the "drop zone" labelled "`Drop File(s)`" in the `Extensions` tab at the bottom right.

Afterwards, restart Vortex and you can begin installing supported The Universim mods with Vortex.
